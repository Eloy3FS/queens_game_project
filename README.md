# 👑 Queen Game Project

This is a personal recreation of LinkedIn's Queen placement puzzle, using Flask and Docker.

## 🧩 How to Play

- Click to cycle between empty → ❌ cross → ♕ queen.
- Drag to place or remove multiple crosses.
- Each queen must follow color and distance constraints.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Flask
- JavaScript frontend
- Hugging Face Spaces (Docker SDK)

## 🚀 Deployment

This Space is built with a custom `Dockerfile` and runs the Flask server on port `7860`.

Enjoy!
