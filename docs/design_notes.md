# Design Notes for the Queen Generation Module (LinkedIn Queens Variant)

## Overview
The goal is to develop a module that generates an NxN board where exactly one queen is placed per row and column, ensuring that no queen can attack another. However, unlike the classical N queens problem, the LinkedIn queens variant only considers conflicts in:
- The same row (handled naturally by our one-queen-per-row design)
- The same column (all previous rows are checked)
- The immediate diagonal neighbors (only the closest cell on the upper left and upper right are considered)

## Module Objectives
- **Generate a Valid Solution:** Create a board that meets the constraints of the LinkedIn queens variant.
- **Solution Representation:** Use a list of lists in Python where each cell contains:
  - `1` to indicate the presence of a queen.
  - `0` to indicate an empty cell.
- **Reusability and Modularity:** The main function should accept the board size as a parameter, allowing reuse in different parts of the project.
- **Unit Tests:** Implement tests to verify:
  - The solution has exactly N rows and N columns.
  - Each row and each column contains exactly one queen.
  - The immediate diagonal cells (one step up-left and one step up-right) do not contain a queen, ensuring no immediate diagonal conflict.

## Algorithm Strategy
- **Backtracking:**  
  - Process the board row by row, attempting to place a queen in a safe position.
  - If a safe position is not found for a row, backtrack to the previous row to try a different placement.
- **Safety Check (LinkedIn Variant):**  
  - **Column Check:** Ensure no queen exists in the same column in any of the previous rows.
  - **Immediate Diagonal Check:** Only verify the cell immediately above to the left (row-1, col-1) and the cell immediately above to the right (row-1, col+1).

## Future Considerations
- **Algorithm Optimization:** Further optimize performance for larger boards.
- **Multiple Solutions:** In the future, consider extending the module to generate multiple solutions instead of stopping at the first valid one.
- **Documentation and Maintenance:** Each function will be thoroughly documented to ease future modifications and integration with other modules (e.g., the coloring and UI modules).

## Additional Notes
- Keep the code modular to facilitate integration into the overall MVC pattern of the project.
- Place unit tests in the `tests/` folder to ensure continuous verification of functionality during development.
